A video about the concept "A Day Made Of Glass", showed us glass could help people to shape a much better future life. Just recently, Corning Inc. released the second video named as  "A Day Made Of Glass 2".

In that video,  we could learn the probability of the concept of the purpose of  glass  in the future daily lives. Each glass product can possess a rich and varied interactive.
